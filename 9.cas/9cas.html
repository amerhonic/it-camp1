      <h1>FERRARI TRIBUTO</h1>
      <h3>LIVE FOR THE MOMENT</h3>
      <p>
        To achieve their goal of making the car’s impressive performance easy to
        access and use, Ferrari’s engineers worked on integrating engine and
        aerodynamics performance with the latest iteration of the vehicle
        dynamics control systems.The Side Slip Control system, which improves
        drivers’ control on the limit for even more engaging involvement, has
        been further evolved. The transition from version 6.0 to 6.1 reflects
        the fact that the Ferrari Dynamic Enhancer system now also activates in
        the manettino RACE (FDE+) position.The cockpit retains the classic,
        driver-oriented look typical of Ferrari’s mid-rear-engined berlinettas.
        Every element of the dash, door panels and tunnel has been completely
        redesigned specifically for the car.
